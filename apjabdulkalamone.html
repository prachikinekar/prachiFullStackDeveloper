        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
                Indian
                aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and
                raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
                spent
                the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                involved in
                India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known
                as
                the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian
                honour.

                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an
                apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
                attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
                honours.
                Early life and education
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                pilgrimage
                centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
                His
                father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
                housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
                Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.

                Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been
                wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar
                are a
                Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and
                local
                women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and
                from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the
                Pamban
                Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties
                were
                lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was
                born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.

                In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who
                had
                a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.After completing
                his
                education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's
                College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.

                Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
                While
                Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
                threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam
                met
                the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you
                to
                meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as
                he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
